              Create an application for parents looking for a way to teach their
              kids about personal and financial responsibility through the
              connection of work and money. It should be a usable and simplistic
              app that allows parents to create profile for their kids and track
              chores.Once child completes a task they are able to receive money
              through a point system that can be applied to a specific savings
              goal that is displayed through this application. The application
              should give option of creating “savings pockets”(or goals) once
              tasks are completed and points are earned.

              This was a design school project and was used to test how we can
              think through (decode) design briefs and come up with a solution.
              The deliverables were userflow and information architecture,
              wireframes,styleguide and high-fidelity prototypes.

              As an important part of the design and also the deliverables,
              after understanding the brief and defining the goals, the next
              thing I did was to create a userflow to guide the design. This is
              a simplified version of it that outlines some of the features I
              think are needed.

              After doing the userflow, went ahead and did some wireframes which
              was part of the deliverables and also lay the foundation for the
              high-fidelity designs. Again, this is the wireframe of some of the
              pages not all of them.

              To keep the visual elements consistent and appealing,we were asked
              to develop a styleguide that consists of typography, color and
              icons.

              After establishing my visual direction and getting clarity on how

              designs.

              I walk the child through a brief introduction of what the app is

              onboarding a bit colorful for the children.

              profile and reviewing tasks.

          This was a fun project to work on,had to do a lot of thinking and
          interations considering it was my first project in Design School and I
          was given a brief to work with.I learnt alot on how to keep user goals
          front-and-center while designing.I spent some time iterating over
          ideas that i thought were cool only to later realise were unnecessary
          and not aligned to the project goals On the visual side,I learnt how
          typography,color and icons should be consistent with brand goals.
